# Problem
Develop scalable time-series forecasting model to predict sales from store-product combinations.

## Approach
The team used a wide range of approached to solve this problem, some of which are documented in the archive folder. These include: Autoregressive moving average (ARIMA), Croston's exponential smoothing, Recurrent Neural Networks, Mixture Density Networks, and Feed forward neural networks. 

The winning model was a feedforward model, which still has to be refined. 

    ## Contributions
    * Autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) - Lucky and Caleb
    * Croston's approach - Andre
    * Feedforward neural network - Milton / Andries
    * Recurrent neural network - Milton / Andries
    * Mixture density network - Andries

# Clustering
To assist in model building as well as product segmentation, product are clustered using various approaches, including self-organizing maps, dimentionality reduction (t-SNE and UMAP) followed by Hierarchical Density Based Clustering (HDBSCAN), or Dynamic Time Warping.
